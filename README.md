# RecipeHub


## Introduction

Welcome to RecipeHub! RecipeHub is a full-stack web application developed as the final project of ALX Software Engineering. It serves as an all-in-one solution for restaurants, providing customers with the ability to view menus, reserve tables, leave reviews, and register as members. Additionally, it includes an intra-system for seamless order management, with sessions for chefs, waiters, and cashiers.

RecipeHub is built using Flask for the backend, MySQL for the database, and HTML, Ajax, and jQuery for the frontend.
